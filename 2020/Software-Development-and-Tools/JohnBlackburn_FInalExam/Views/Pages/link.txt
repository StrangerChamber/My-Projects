Wasn't able to deploy correctly on heroku, had plenty of issues with it I worked through
but every solved issue brought out five more new issues so I'm just gonna call it here
and take what I get. I got it working well on the front end locally, didn't get
the DB set up right and was still a little confused with my get and post requests but
had I had a few more days I believe I could've implemented the complete application.

Great class I learned a lot about web development and leave with much more knowledge
that I came in with :)
