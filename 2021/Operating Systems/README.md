CSCI 3753 - Operating Systems

Learned about linux operating system, it's components, and processes. Learned about semaphores, distributed memory systems, spinlocks, device drivers, and more through the course. Didn't save much of my work to my computer so all I have here is some of my work regarding a program handling a queue with multithreading and semaphores.
