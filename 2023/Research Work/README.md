My senior year I joined a research Project, Project GHOST (5G Hidden Operations through Securing Traffic), a project that addresses the core intellectual challenge of providing secure communications resistant to penetration and traffic analysis over untrusted networks. My role was to research Trusted Execution Environments such as ARM Trustzone and Intel SGX, and learn how we could leverage these technologies to do secure packet processing. I setup computers to run SGX, and wrote applications on top of the SGX framework. This project is still underway and most of this above is just scratch work, will update this after my graduation in spring 2023.
