My senior year I joined a research Project, Project GHOST (5G Hidden Operations through Securing Traffic), a project that addresses the core intellectual challenge of providing secure communications resistant to penetration and traffic analysis over untrusted networks. My role was to research Trusted Execution Environments such as ARM Trustzone and Intel SGX, and learn how we could leverage these technologies to do secure packet processing. I setup computers to run SGX, and wrote applications on top of the SGX framework. The culmination of my work is in the Obfuscating Patterns of Life With Trusted Execution Environments pdf in this folder, it's the research paper that resulted from this work.
