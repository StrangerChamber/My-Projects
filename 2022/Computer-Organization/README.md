CSCI 4593 - Computer Organization

Learned about the architecture of RISC-V 32 bit processors, the logic used to build them, and the mechanisms used to make them more efficient. Main deliverable of the course was a semester long project to build out the logic of a RISC-V 32 bit processor. The professor gave us the skeleton and framework for the project and we did the rest. We implemented a multi-stage data pipeline, that implemented data-forwarding, and had hazard detection. However, due to the bredth of the project and the size of some of the files I cannot upload it in full here on github.
