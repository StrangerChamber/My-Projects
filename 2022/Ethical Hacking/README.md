CSCI 4413 - Security and Ethical Hacking

Learned the fundamentals of computer security and common exploits. Covered linux based exploits, web-framework exploits, and buffer overflow exploits. Most of my code for this was just scratch work, since a lot of the work was writing scripts for the command line to use. This course was my favorite I took at CU, I feel like everything I had learned up to this point was used and built upon. The assignments were game-like, meaning that each exploit was an level that escalated our priviliges on a machine. And the final was really interesting, we broke into teams and were each given a website URL and told to pass the final we had to get root on the machine that hosted the website. After 3 hours and 15 or so exploits later we had root. Overall most stimulating course I took by far at CU.
